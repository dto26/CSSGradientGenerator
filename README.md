# CSSGradientGenerator
Generate a CSS gradient background using color detection from an image. Also custom creation using hex codes.

## How it works:
Currenty just a quick proof of concept.
The CSS gradient is shown at the top of the page. An input form underneath takes 2 hexcodes.
When the 'Generate' button is clicked the gradient updates with the user input hexcodes.
No validation/rules have been applied yet. '#' is required in each input field. No error checking yet.
